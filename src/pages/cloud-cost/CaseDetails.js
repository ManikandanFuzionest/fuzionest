                Moving to the Cloud is not actually a wonder for achieving cost
                optimization. It is a continuous journey of monitoring and
                aligning resources with goals to achieve the desired cost
                structure. The availability and ease of use of Cloud resources
                comes with an associated reality that costs tend to increase
                with time. However, Cloud-native provides granular insights into
                each Cloud resource and improves return on investment.

                Costing involves a consideration of various aspects like
                rightsizing for your applications, selecting a pricing model
                that suits your business, tagging resources and scaling based on
                demand.

                There are several ways to track and save on your AWS cloud
                computing costs. Apart from continuous monitoring, it also
                involves optimizing storage, right provisioning, leveraging
                compute instances for flexibility, autoscaling and automation.
